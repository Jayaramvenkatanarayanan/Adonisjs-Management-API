## Brief

Please check the following notes before creating any issue. Well formatted and concise descriptions will help us address your issues quickly

### Is this just a query?
If your question is just a query and not a bug or feature request. Consider asking it inside the [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/adonisjs/adonis-framework)

### Do you have multiple questions?
Please keep an issue focused on a single concern. Asking too many questions will confuse everyone.


## Choose the correct repo
Everyone has a tendency of creating issues inside `adonis-framework` repo. Please note adonis is a combination of several repos and creating issues in their dedicated repos will help everyone track existing issues and their fixes in a better way. For example:

1. ORM related issues should go to [adonis-lucid](https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-lucid)
2. Auth related issues should go to [adonis-auth](https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-auth)

Please check the [organization home page](https://github.com/adonisjs) to see the list of repos
